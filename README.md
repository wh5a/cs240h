# Basics

## Tip: variable names

* Inner functions (e.g., `loop`) often have arguments related to
  outer function
    * It is legal to shadow bindings and re-use variable names, but
      the compiler will warn you
    * Typical practice is to add `'` (prime) to the inner-function's
      argument
    * Haskell accepts the `'` character in variables, except as first
      character
* Personally, I find this practice a bit error-prone
    * While learning Haskell, I repeatedly made the error of dropping
      primes, e.g.:

    ~~~ {.haskell}
    factorial n = loop 1 n
        where loop acc n' | n' > 1    = loop (acc * n) (n' - 1) -- bug
                          | otherwise = acc
    ~~~

    * You can avoid the problem by using the longer symbol name for
      the outer function

    ~~~ {.haskell}
    factorial n0 = loop 1 n0
        where loop acc n | n > 1     = loop (acc * n) (n - 1)
                         | otherwise = acc
    ~~~

    * Here accidentally typing "`factorial n0 = loop 1 n`" causes
      compile error

## Running `urldump`

~~~~
$ ghc --make urldump
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( urldump.hs, urldump.o )
Linking urldump ...
$ ./urldump http://www.scs.stanford.edu/
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"
...
~~~~

* What if you want to run it in GHCI?

    ~~~~
$ ghci ./urldump.hs
Prelude Main>
    ~~~~

    * No `*` before `Main` means no access to internal symbols (because
      compiled)

    ~~~~
Prelude Main> :load *urldump.hs
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( urldump.hs, interpreted )
Ok, modules loaded: Main.
*Main> withArgs ["http://cs240h.scs.stanford.edu/"] main
    ~~~~

    * Alternate GHCI shortcut:

    ~~~~
Prelude Main> :main "http://cs240h.scs.stanford.edu/"
    ~~~~
